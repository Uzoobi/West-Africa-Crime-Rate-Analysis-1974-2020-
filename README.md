Recommendations to ECOWAS and Security Agencies

1.       Strengthening Regional Security Collaboration

Unified Task Force: Establish a Regional Joint Task Force under the auspices of ECOWAS to coordinate efforts across member states for intelligence sharing, surveillance, and counter-terrorism operations. Focus areas include Nigeria, Cameroon, and other hotspots.
Cross-Border Patrols: Enhance border security operations to monitor and prevent the movement of insurgents and illegal arms across West African borders, particularly in high-crime regions like Maiduguri.

2.      Addressing Insurgent Groups and Organized Crime

Targeted Counter-Insurgency Strategies: Deploy specialized military and intelligence units to combat Boko Haram and other extremist groups, particularly in Nigeria and the Lake Chad region.
De-radicalization Programs: Implement community-based de-radicalization and reintegration programs to reduce recruitment by extremist organizations.
Improved Investigation: Address the 1,628 “Unknown Perpetrators” through better crime investigations and forensics to identify culprits and reduce anonymity in reported crimes.

3.      Enhancing Law Enforcement Capacity

Training and Modernization: Invest in advanced training, equipment, and technology for law enforcement agencies to effectively combat crime, particularly armed assaults and bombings.
Rapid Response Units: Develop well-equipped Rapid Response Units capable of immediate intervention in identified crime hotspots.

4.      Improving Intelligence and Surveillance Systems

Early Warning Systems: Establish regional intelligence and early-warning mechanisms to detect threats and criminal activities in real-time.
Community Intelligence: Foster stronger collaboration between security agencies and local communities to gather actionable intelligence.

5.      Weapon Control and Monitoring

Arms Trafficking Control: Collaborate with international organizations to curb the influx of illegal arms and explosives into the region.
Disarmament Initiatives: Launch weapon retrieval and disarmament programs targeting conflict-affected areas where armed assault and bombings are prevalent.
